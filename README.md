# Nuria Coding Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenge for the company Nuria. The challenge consists of two questions, and each question's solution is provided in a separate Java file.

## Questions

The description of two questions are located in the [PDF file](https://github.com/joaoalcimar/nuria-challenge/blob/master/Nuria-Software-Engineer-Backend.pdf).

## How to Run

To run each Java file, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have the Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.

2. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository using the `cd` command.

4. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command.

>>This will generate a `.class` file in the same directory.

5. Run the Java program using the `java` command.

>>You should see the output of the program in the command prompt.

That's it! If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to contact me.
